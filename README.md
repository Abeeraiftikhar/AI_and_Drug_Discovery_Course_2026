This repository contains projects completed during an AI and Biotechnology/Bioinformatics internship, focusing on protein structure prediction, molecular docking, sequence analysis, genomic data processing, and AI-based biological research. It reflects hands-on training in modern computational biology tools and techniques.

📖 Overview

This repository contains projects, assignments, and research work completed during an AI and Biotechnology/Bioinformatics internship. The main objective of this internship was to develop practical skills in computational biology, artificial intelligence, and data-driven life science research.

The work presented here reflects hands-on experience in protein structure prediction, molecular docking, sequence analysis, genomic data processing, machine learning applications, and biological data visualization.

Assignment 1: Structural Profiling of Breast Cancer Proteins

This project focuses on the analysis of breast cancer–associated genes and their corresponding proteins using UniProt and the Protein Data Bank (PDB). A total of 20 target proteins were evaluated for the availability of experimentally determined 3D structures. The study highlights the importance of structural data in understanding cancer mechanisms and supporting drug discovery research.

Assignment 2: QSAR Data Curation Using ChEMBL

Target: BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2)
Bioactivity Records: 86 IC50 measurements

Project Description

This assignment demonstrates the retrieval, evaluation, and curation of bioactivity data for QSAR modeling using the ChEMBL database. Bioactivity records related to BCL2 were collected, filtered, standardized, and prepared for analysis.

Data Curation Workflow

Target Selection → ChEMBL Data Retrieval → Data Evaluation → Data Cleaning & Standardization → Curated Dataset

The workflow includes selecting IC50 values, removing invalid and duplicate entries, standardizing units to nM, and exporting the final curated dataset in CSV format for downstream QSAR analysis.
